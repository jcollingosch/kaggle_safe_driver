## Data Description

In this competition, you will predict the probability that an auto insurance policy holder files a claim.

In the train and test data, features that belong to similar groupings are tagged as such in the feature names (e.g., ind, reg, car, calc). In addition, feature names include the postfix bin to indicate binary features and cat to indicate categorical features. Features without these designations are either continuous or ordinal. Values of -1 indicate that the feature was missing from the observation. The target columns signifies whether or not a claim was filed for that policy holder.

"Ind" is related to individual or driver, "reg" is related to region, "car" is related to car itself and "calc" is an calculated feature.
